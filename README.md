# python-interactive-calculator
A simple interactive command-line calculator in Python with memory, error handling, and extended math operations.
# 🧮 Python Interactive Calculator  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This is a simple **command-line calculator** built in Python. It goes beyond the basic `+ - × ÷` operations by including:  
- Exponentiation (x^y)  
- Square root  
- A **memory feature** to reuse the last result  
- Error handling to prevent crashes from invalid inputs  

The calculator is interactive: after each calculation, it shows a menu and lets the user continue until they type `"exit"`.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Many beginner calculators stop after a single calculation, forcing the user to restart the program. I wanted to create a **lightweight, user-friendly calculator** that feels more like a real tool:  
- Continuous usage (menu repeats).  
- Stores past results (memory).  
- Gracefully handles errors (e.g., letters instead of numbers, division by zero).  

This project demonstrates **modular programming, error handling, and user interaction design** in Python.
